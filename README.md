# DFA_Minimization - Lab 3 (Homework)
This is the repository which corresponds to the laboratory 3. In which we have a minimization engine for a DFA based on the Myhill-Nerode's Theorem covered
in the CS112 course.

### Requirements
---
* Python v3.10

### How to start
---
To run either of the file check the -h section of them in short to run the ```dfa_minimization_engine.py``` you should run:
```
python3 dfa_minimization_engine.py dfa_config_file <OPTIONAL for security reasons maximum number of cycles to mark the pairs>
```
